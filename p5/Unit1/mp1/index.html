  <p><b>Brother Baker</b> <br>

    Ricardo Rhodes was an ordinary individual who was visited by disguised extraordinary travelers from another world. <br> Ricardo patiently explained to these travelers the basics of modern human society. <br>Moved by Ricardo's kindness despite
    being trapped in what they understood to be a barbaric societial and cultural machine of cutthroat misery. <br> They decided to grant Ricardo a boon. <br>Asking what Ricardo desired they heard him say, "Bread is pretty good". <br> With advanced
    nanomachines they constructed a Bread Atomization Ray in Ricardo's eyes. <br> Now Ricardo Rhodes is known by his new moniker, Brother Baker, as a man who altruisticly distributes glutten free bread to those desiring food. <br> For a small period
    of time, the world is just ever slightly better.
